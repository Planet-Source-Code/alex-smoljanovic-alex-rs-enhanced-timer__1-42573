Before you attempt to run or compile the example project you must first compile the ExtendedTimer.vbp project.
Doing this will register this Active-X User control's classe(s) to which to example project will interface with.

If you use this control in you're application you must also redistribute it and register it on the clients machine.
If you wish not to redistribute this along with you're application, then add the UserControl file: ExtTimer.ctl to you're project. Note: If you do this VB will automatically change this classes public property to false, if you wish to re-compile the user control project in the future you must change its public property to true.
